<h3>Section 11: Day 11 - Beginner - The Blackjack Capstone Project</h3>
<b>Skills and concepts:</b><br>
Deal both user and computer a starting hand of 2 random card values.<br>
Detect when computer or user has a blackjack. (Ace + 10 value card).<br>
If computer gets blackjack, then the user loses (even if the user also has a blackjack). If the user gets a blackjack, then they win (unless the computer also has a blackjack).<br>
Calculate the user's and computer's scores based on their card values.<br>
If an ace is drawn, count it as 11. But if the total goes over 21, count the ace as 1 instead.<br>
Reveal computer's first card to the user.<br>
Game ends immediately when user score goes over 21 or if the user or computer gets a blackjack.<br>
Ask the user if they want to get another card.<br>
Once the user is done and no longer wants to draw any more cards, let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards unless their score goes over 16.<br>
Compare user and computer scores and see if it's a win, loss, or draw.<br>
Print out the player's and computer's final hand and their scores at the end of the game.<br>
After the game ends, ask the user if they'd like to play again.
